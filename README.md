## Geospatial Python (Pandas) Project

In this project, The [data.nashville.gov](data.nashville.gov) open data portal was used to explore the Geospatial Environment in Python Pandas.

The data selected for this project were:

1. Traffic Accidents
2. Metro Nashville School districts

After selecting the data, they were brought into the Geospatial environment and examined. 

### **Data question:**
Which school districts have the highest rate of pedestrian accidents?<br /> This question was chosen because parents would likely want to choose school districts with less frequent pedestrian accidents for their children walking to and from school.
